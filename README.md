### Hey yo, I’m Vy. 👋
- 👀 I’m passionately curious about molecular biology, statistics, data science. Hope that I will do something including all those fields. 
- 🌱 I love learning on Coursera especially audit courses.  
- 💞️ I also like to connect or engage with strangers too because I basically love to laugh, learn and talk about things I haven't known yet.
