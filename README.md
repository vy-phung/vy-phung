### Hey yo, I’m Vy. 👋
My name is pronounced as same as the letter V in the alphabet so sometimes you can call me V
- 👀 I’m passionately curious about molecular biology, statistics, data science. Hope that I will do something including all those fields. 
- 🌱 I love learning on Coursera especially audit courses.  
- 💞️ Anyway, learning is fun, isnt it? So it is great that I can find a friend or a partner who loves learning and exploring something new and cool.
